CLVShare is inspired by PS4Share and CLV is Nintendo's internal name of NES/SNES classic.

## Prerequisites

You have to replace kernel of your console using hakchi2(https://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2)

**Using hakchi2 may brick your console!** I've already bricked my console twice :-) Calm down, probably bricked console can be restored with a backup file. But don't try with your father/child/friend's console if you want not to lose your special person.

This application doesn't implement complete OAuth flow. You have to get tokens on Twitter developer web.
